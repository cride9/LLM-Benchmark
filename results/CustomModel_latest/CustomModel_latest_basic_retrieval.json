The number of individual specimens would depend on how one defines \"specimen.\" Many collectors have assembled collections over time, but it's difficult to quantify the exact number without a comprehensive registry or inventory.\n\nIf you are referring to specific collections that could be considered large-scale, such as museums, private institutions, or significant auction houses, then I would need more information about these organizations and their holdings to provide an accurate response. For example, the Victoria & Albert Museum in London contains a substantial collection of music boxes from various periods, but it is not without controversy due to concerns over authenticity and provenance.\n\nIn summary, while there are many antique music box enthusiasts and collectors worldwide, I couldn't find a single large-scale or complete collection dedicated solely to this art form at the time of my last update.",

This nebula was discovered during a mission called ESA's XMM-Newton and later observed using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, but the detection of high-resolution images provided by the James Webb Space Telescope will offer new insights into its structure and composition.",
